# Serverless API Project based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Welcome to my Serverless API project, built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles! In this repository, you'll find the source code and infrastructure required to deploy a serverless API on the AWS cloud, following the principles of Domain-Driven Design.

## Folder Structure and Design

This project follows the structure and principles of Domain-Driven Design to organize code and application architecture. The core idea of DDD is to model the application domain robustly and reflect that modeling in the code structure.

## How to use?

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
